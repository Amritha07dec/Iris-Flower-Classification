## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The **Iris Flower Classification** project is a beginner-friendly dataset and machine learning task. The dataset consists of 150 samples, each described by four features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

The task is to classify the samples into one of three species:  
1. Setosa  
2. Versicolor  
3. Virginica
